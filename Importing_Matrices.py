# Simple example of reading a csv file in and converting to a list of lists


# Import the csv module for handling data
import csv

# This reads in the comma separated values as a list of lists of strings
#                                               Each line is a list

with open("matrix.txt") as f:

  d = list(reader)

print("The original lists of lists:")
print(d)
print("\n")

# By default lists have strings as entries, so convert them to floats

for i in range(len(d)):
  for j in range(len (d[i])):
    d[i][j]=float(d[i][j])
